For the first few weeks, I planned on taking it easy and figuring out what I wanted to do. So here I am, sitting in a coffee shop chilling out, typing away and planning the next project. Why do people have private meetings in public places, coffee shops seem to be a hotspot for this too, strange!

## Goals

In a previous post, I still had a few things to sort out before I went part-time. Well, am happy to say that I managed to get all that done plus I have deactivated my Linkedin account. It hasn't stopped recruiters sending jobs specs. I also added a few new goals to the Trello board and removed one. 

**NextBike Handler**

The project that I removed was the [NextBike][1] [Litabot][2] handler. I had started this before, but I had a bad experience with Nextbike where they took money from my bank account. It turns out it was a mistake and they put it back, but the fact they did that was a bit alarming. So I have stopped using Nextbike and now walk instead, it's an excellent time to catch up on podcasts! What I have done is open source what I had which is a functional handler but a bit rough around the edges. You can take a look at it over at [Github][3] I have named it Gendry as that's the name of a helper bot I use. 


**Elixir & Phoenix Framework**

I wanted to try a new programming language instead of my goto Ruby. Ruby was always easy and straightforward to get a project up and running. Recently I heard about how good functional programming languages are. [Elixir][4] his getting a lot of attention and is the top chose for 2017. 

A friend of mine gave me a few books about it, and I also started a course on [Udemy][5] about it. I have already completed the course, and it was fun. I have my doubts about it tho, am not sold on some of the concepts of functional programming. The syntax can be very confusing, and I was looking information up even for basic functions. 

Even after all that I will still be using [Elixir][4] and [Phoenix][6] for my next project. 

**Dashboard Plugins** 

I was a **huge** fan of the [Dashing Framework][7] I used it in every job to build a dashboard. Dashing is an abandoned project, but it still gets pull requests on GitHub which do get accepted. Elixir has its version of Dashing called [Kitto][8], result!

So my next project will be creating various plugins for that a few ideas I have in mind so far are: 

  - AWS Dashboard
  - Goss Plugin
  - Gitlab Build Status

I will start planning this out some point later today.

**Target**

In four weeks time, I can have some of this list done!

 - At least one Dashboard plugin. 
 - A lovely holiday!
