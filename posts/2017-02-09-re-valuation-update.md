Last time I was in a strange place, I wasn't motivated to do anything. My skillset has stagnated and I was losing focus. Take a look at my previous post for some details. 

The first things that I wanted set up was a Trello board with a list of tasks/goals that I should do. Trello helped me out so much creating all the tasks I wanted to do. That night when I got home, I started with the first few tasks on the list.

## Work

I approached my bosses about it and explained how I felt focusing on how it can help the business. They have agreed that I can go from a five-day working week to a four day week, taking the Wednesday off! 

I am already feeling more upbeat about how things are heading. 

Goal one achieved! 

## Distractions

Okay so I thought this would be a hard one to do, I had one thing going for me, though, and that was I never had a facebook account.

I deleted my Reddit account, first of all, I removed it one morning before work. Later that night I was quite surprised how much time I spent on Reddit caught in the loop of meme after meme. Twitter, Slack & IRC were no hassles to remove. I don't miss them, and no one has ever said anything to me not being on there anymore. 

Now on to the problem account, Linkedin. I couldn't delete it. I have it in my head that Linkedin is the key to me getting some new fantastic job that I will never get the chance out with LinkedIn. My Linkedin account does remain, but I have turned off all notifications, and I get no emails from the account. 

Removing myself from any email lists that I get that don't provide me with any benefit. My mailbox is looking light these days which is great. 

I have deleted all social media applications from my phone. I created a priority group which I added a select people too. If someone out with that list calls I get no notification, alert or email. 

I am triumphal with this progress, and I do feel that I can turn off a lot more. I hope that sometime before now and my next post I will have the willpower to delete that account!

Goal two achieved!

## Minimalism

I had various collectables around the house such as Collectors Editions, Raid Decks and Comics. I sold all these on eBay and anything that I never sold went to close friends and then finally to the charity shop. 

I also forgot about how many mechanical keyboards I had collected over the years that I had ever even used! Up on eBay they went, some ever sold for quite a bit money! 

Lots of cables went in the bin, who needs 12 cat5 cables in a tiny flat where most devices are wireless?

The only item I still have to do is clear out my old clothes; this is not because I can't bring myself to do it. It's down to the fact that I have been so busy with the other items on the Trello board that I haven't had the time yet. 

I have made a bit of money from all the Ebay selling, and like there isn't so much crap laying about anymore. I would go out of my way to buy things to add to various collection's. Well, now I dont so this month's budget is way under already cause I am buying so much less crap. 


## New goals!

I am going to give myself a few goals, but they will be smaller this time around. One thing that I want to do is create a browser start page with only the common sites that I visit. I found that I would get sidetracked when I was going to check something online. 


  - Get rid of LinkedIn once and for all!
  - First "project" - start page. 
  - Finish up with gutting out my clothes.
  - Go on a lovely holiday with my wife.
