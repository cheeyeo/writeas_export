For a while now I have not felt a great sense of accomplishment with work and personal projects. 

In work projects have stalled or dragged on for 8+ months, meaning there is surprisingly little work from my side needs doing at work. The daily grind is just making sure everything is working fine and pass some recommended fixes or improvements up the chain to get authorised, but they never do. 

Even outside of personal work projects I have never even got off the ground even after buying hardware I need. I end up getting home at the end of the working day, and I am not motivated to work on any of my personal projects I end up just procrastinating on Youtube, Reddit or some other social media site or half arsing something. It need's to get fixed else it's going to turn into a problem for my future if it hasn't already!

# Time to sort it out

I think there are a few key issues that will help me get my focus back and help me feel like I have accomplished something and contribute to improving my skillset. 

## Work 

I think work is a big issue for me; I come home feeling drained even tho I haven't been doing anything. Most of my day is spent doing basic sysadmin tasks such as checking for missing emails, setting up PCs or user accounts. Out with the odd flurry DevOps work to setup a project via CI, [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), etc. that is my average working day. The company are very hesitant on making decisions on anything new or replacing old processes etc. 

I can also see issues down the line which I don't have the right tools or resources to fix these problems currently. I take great pride and professionalism in my work, and cause I can't fully achieve this, it creates a lot of [negative stress](http://kimberlysnyder.com/blog/2014/03/21/can-tell-difference-good-stress-bad-stress/) for me. 

The developers don't/can't use anything modern due to decision making, so I am anxious about my future as my skillset has stagnated as I can only implement solutions around what they are using and the business decisions that go along with that. 

All of this adds up, so my plan is quite simple, yet I think it will give me space to move on with the other ways I can improve myself. 

**Part Time.**

The first thing I will be doing, and hopefully, the business will agree to it is reducing my working week to four days. I am lucky enough to be able to afford this and to be honest if I stop buying things that I just don't use or need then I could properly get away with a three day week. It would be great if I could work something like Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday as this would break the week up quite well.

## Distractions 

I have too many distractions in my life from social media to tech toys that I pick up and play with for a few hours but achieve nothing of real value. After reading an excellent book by Cal Newport called [Deep Work](http://calnewport.com/books/deep-work/), I could relate to a lot of what he was saying, and I will also be implementing some of his advice. 

**Social Media**

After a conversation with a work college about how he was so pissed off with something on Reddit, he couldn't sleep right as it was bugging him so much. It hit home to me that this has happened to me on more than one occasion. 

I have already started to delete or deactivate my social media accounts and here is a list of them. 

  * Reddit
  * Twitter
  * Linkedin 
  * Slack
  * IRC

Outwith social media there are other distractions that I just did not notice that were adding to the diversions, here are a few examples.

  * Push notifications to my phone for apps that are not needed.
  * Email alerts, youtube notifications via chrome or firefox.
  * Useless emails from mailing lists I have signed up too. 

# Minimalism

I am a huge fan of [minimalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_living) much to the annoyance of my wife when I try and get rid of something she hasn't used within a year!. I have been approaching minimalism from the wrong angle; I really should start applying it to all the tech that is laying about but hardly used and not just to general household items.

Not only will this help with the distractions, but it will also contribute to saving money, will also reduce clutter around the house and save time on maintenance, etc.

So I will be selling all my tech that I don't use on eBay, if they don't sell on eBay after the first few attempts, I will give them to a local charity or mates if they want anything.

# Goals

Setting achievable goals within a reasonable time frame is what I will be doing. I want to do projects that will be interesting, advance my career and have something tangible at the end that I can showcase if I wanted too. I already use [Trello](https://trello.com/) to manage day-to-day tasks, so I will use that to add project ideas to a board, or anything that I find could be a good fit. 

Once all the distractions are done, and my road to minimalism is under way I will sit down for an afternoon and go through the list and see what is most appealing. I will set milestones for the chosen project and set aside the extra day I have off just to work on this project. 

So that's it, I shall see how it goes for the next month and write a follow-up post. 

TLDR; 

  * Reduce my working week.
  * Getting rid of all distractions.
  * Set some realistic goals.
