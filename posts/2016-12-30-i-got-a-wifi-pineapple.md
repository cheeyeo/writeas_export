I was planning on writing a nice wee article about how great the Wifi Pineapple is but **fuck** I got bored of it after an hour as it didn't seem to bring anything new to the table.

I have heard lots about hak5 and the [Wifi Pineapple][pineapple] that they sell, both good and bad. So when a [friend of mine][chee] had finished with his and offered me the Mark V WiFi Pineapple - I couldn't pass this up.

I can only guess that the point of a pineapple is how simple it is to use and small design of the device. I think the main selling point is how easy it is to use so you would hope the web interface would be easy to use, boy was I wrong. It is without a doubt one of the worst UI's I have seen in quite a while, that being said they stated that they would back port the current UI used in the NANO version to the Mark V when it is stable.

They pimp the fact it has a pen testing suite called PineAP for carrying out audits etc. but to me, the pineapple is nothing new. It is just a wrapper around tools which you can run on a [Kali][kali] or even a [RaspberryPi][pi] if you know your way around a shell.

If you are carrying out a pentest, I can see this being handy to plug in, create a reverse SSH session and do what you need.

**Conclusion**: a Convenient tool for pen testers and people who want to be arseholes!
